        the `RS256` algorithm for the signature, and publish to all providers the public key for
        verifying that signature.

        The following fields must be included in the JWT claim for access tokens issued
        by this authority:
        * `iss`, with the URL at which the token generation request was received.
        * `exp`, with a time no further than 1 hour in the future.
        * `sub`, with unique ID of the client requesting the access token.
        * `scope`, with an array of strings indicating the scopes granted.

        The tokens granted by this authority must protect against reuse of received
        tokens to impersonate the sender to other recipients (via use of the `aud` claim or
        other means).

        When using the `aud` claim to protect against the reuse of received
        tokens, and absent guidance on behalf of the competent authority to the
        contrary, the JWT `aud` claim requested by the client must be included
        in each access token and must contain the fully qualified domain name of
        the URL the access token will be used to access.
