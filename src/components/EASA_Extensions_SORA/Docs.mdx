# Overview

The Map component showcases how to run the ArcGIS Map component inside Constellation UI - The [ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/) helps build interactive user experiences and 2D and 3D visualizations.

The component supports the following features:

- Center on a global map by providing latitude, longitude and zoom
- Read only mode support when put in the display template - no freeform drawing or draw some positions

# Example

To use this component for mapping a route, set bFreeFormDrawing to false. You will need an embedded data list with 2 fields: Latitude and Longitude. In a form template, add a new view based on this template and select the 2 properties
from the embedded list data object - make sure to put the Latitude field first. If needed, you can specify a 3rd field on the case type formatted as URL that can hold
an image of the map - the Image field must be large enough to hold the base64 content (see length to 50000) and should not have any validation enabled on the field for URL.

Here is an example of how to configure this component in App Studio when bFreeFormDrawing is false. For this example, we have created a 'Map' case type and we will render Map component.
The case type is composed of an embedded data list called 'Positions'

To use the template, add the fields to the region in this order

To use this component as a location field, add a location field to the region of the template and set bFreeFormDrawing to true. You can enable search and get your current location.
